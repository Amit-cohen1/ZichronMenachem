<h1 align="center">Welcome to ZichronMenachem </h1>
<p>
</p>
The Zichron Menahem non-profit organization helps children with cancer and their families. As part of their services, they provide medical care and manage medical information for the children. The goal of this project is to build a web application that will allow the organization to manage all medical information for the children they serve.

The web application will have three different types of users: admin, medical staff, and parents. The admin user will manage all users' permissions, the medical staff will be able to upload documents and add input to the children's profiles, and parents will be able to sign on documents and view data on their child.
